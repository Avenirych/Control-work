1 Step 
Getting the first array of strings from the keyboard.
Step 2
The condition is checked: the length of each element of the array is less than or equal to 3.
Step 4
If the condition is true, then we create a second array and convert the resulting string into an array, splitting the string into substrings using spaces. Each substring is an element of a new array.
If there are no elements in the specified array that match this condition, the output will be an empty array.
